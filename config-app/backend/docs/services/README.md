## 🚀 Active Services

### Core Services
- **MQTT Monitor** - Real-time MQTT message processing
- **Macro Executor** - Automated task execution engine
- **Telegram Notifier** - Alert and notification delivery
- **Background Tasks** - Scheduled and queued operations

### Service Architecture
- **Dependency Injection** - Clean service boundaries
- **Event-Driven** - Async message handling
- **Health Monitoring** - Service status tracking
- **Error Recovery** - Graceful failure handling

## 🔧 Configuration
Each service is configured through:
- Environment variables
- Configuration files
- Runtime parameters
- Health check endpoints

## 📊 Monitoring
- **Service Health** - `/health` endpoints
- **Metrics Collection** - Performance monitoring
- **Log Aggregation** - Centralized logging
- **Alert Systems** - Failure notifications

## 🛠️ Development
- **Service Interface** - Abstract base classes
- **Testing Strategy** - Unit and integration tests
- **Mock Services** - Development and testing mocks
- **Documentation** - API and behavior specs

## 📝 Service Standards
All services should implement:
- Health check endpoints
- Graceful shutdown handling
- Configuration validation
- Structured logging
- Error reporting
- Performance metrics
