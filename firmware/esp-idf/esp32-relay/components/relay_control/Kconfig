            If enabled, relay logic is inverted:
            - HIGH = OFF (relay not energized)
            - LOW = ON (relay energized)

            Enable advanced relay protection features like:
            - Switch counting
            - Temperature monitoring
            - Overload detection

        string "Relay GPIO pin mapping"
        default "{2,4,16,17,5,18,19,21}"
        help
            GPIO pin mapping for relay channels in array format.
            Example: {2,4,16,17,5,18,19,21} for 8 channels.
